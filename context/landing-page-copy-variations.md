---

## The Problem You Know Too Well

You can build an MVP in a weekend with Claude Code or Cursor.

But you spend months building the wrong thing.

Customer interviews take too long. You don't know what questions to ask.
Your friends give biased feedback. Traditional research costs thousands.

So you skip validation and hope for the best.

**There's a better way.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. Interview Customers the Right Way
Get the perfect questions for your idea based on Jobs-to-be-Done methodology.
Learn the framework while you work. Know what to build in days, not weeks.

### 2. Test Before You Launch  
Paste your landing page URL or HTML. Get 100 user responses in 60 seconds.
See what converts before spending a dollar on ads.

### 3. Build With Context
Install our MCP server with one command. Now Claude Code reads your validated 
customer insights while you build. Every feature matches real customer needs.

## Complete Landing Page: Version 3 (Integration-First)

```markdown
# Claude Code Knows Your Customers. Finally.

The validation platform that connects customer interviews
to your coding workflow via MCP.

---

## The Missing Link

Claude Code is incredible at writing code.

Terrible at knowing *what* to write.

Every time you prompt Claude, you're re-explaining context:
- "Users want speed, but they're anxious about AI accuracy..."
- "Our ICP is technical founders who..."
- "They said they hate complex workflows..."

**What if Claude already knew all this?**

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Validate Your Idea

**Generate Interview Questions**
`> "I'm building a project management tool for designers"`

Get 7 Jobs-to-be-Done questions that reveal what to build.

**Analyze Interview Notes**  
Paste your interview transcripts. Get:
- Force profiles (push, pull, anxiety, habit)
- Struggling moments timeline  
- Exact customer language patterns
- Build/don't build recommendation

**Test Landing Page**
Paste your page. Get 100 user responses.
Conversion prediction + specific recommendations.

---

### Step 2: Connect to Claude Code

One command in your terminal:

```bash
npx validated-context init
```

This installs an MCP server that:
- Exposes your validation data to Claude Code
- Updates in real-time as you interview more customers
- Works with any MCP-compatible tool (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)

---

### Step 3: Build With Context

Now when you prompt Claude Code:

**You type:**
`> "Build my landing page"`

**Claude Code automatically queries MCP:**
- Gets force profile (Push: "wasting time", Anxiety: "trust AI")
- Gets customer language ("embarrassing", "confident")
- Gets positioning from your interviews

**Claude Code generates:**
- Headlines using exact customer pain words
- Features that address top forces
- Anxiety-reduction copy for trust barriers
- CTA that matches their decision stage

**Result:** 68% predicted conversion vs. 15% generic

---

## The Difference

### Without MCP Integration

```
You: "Build my landing page"

Claude: [Generates generic template]
"Try our amazing platform! 
Sign up today for exclusive access!"

Conversion: ~15%
```

### With MCP Integration

```
You: "Build my landing page"

Claude: [Queries validated-context MCP server]
[Reads: Force profile, customer language, anxiety barriers]

"Stop wasting weeks building products nobody wants.
Interview customers in days, then build with Claude Code
using those insights."

Conversion: ~68%
```

---

## FAQ

**What is MCP?**
Model Context Protocol. Open standard from Anthropic for connecting 
context sources (like your validation data) to Claude-based tools.

**Do I need to use the MCP integration?**
Nope. The interview and testing tools work standalone. MCP is optional but powerful.

**Is the MCP server open source?**
Yes. Published to NPM and GitHub. You can audit the code.

**What if I use Cursor, not Claude Code?**
Cursor fully supports MCP. Works the same way.

**Does this only work for landing pages?**
No. Works for features, copy, PRDs, anything Claude Code helps you build.

## Complete Landing Page: Version 4 (Outcome-First)

```markdown
# Build Products People Actually Pay For

Validate ideas through structured customer interviews,
test your landing page, then build with context Claude Code can read.

---

## The Reality of Indie Building

Out of 100 products built by solo founders:
- **5** make their first dollar
- **40** get users but no revenue  
- **55** get nothing

You're not building wrong. You're building the wrong thing.

---

## What If You Could Predict Success?

**Before building anything**, you could know:
- Is this problem painful enough to pay for?
- Will my landing page convert visitors?
- Which features matter most?
- What price point works?

**Then build with that context**, so Claude Code generates:
- Copy using exact customer language
- Features addressing real pain points
- Pricing that matches perceived value

**You go from 5% to 50% success rate.**

---

## How It Works

### Validate: Interview Customers

**Generate Questions**
Enter your idea. Get 7 Jobs-to-be-Done interview questions
that reveal if people will actually pay.

**Conduct Interviews**
Talk to 10 people who have your target problem.
No sales pitch. Just questions about their struggles.

**Analyze Results**
Paste your interview notes. Get:
- Force analysis (push, pull, anxiety, habit)
- Build/don't build recommendation
- Exact customer language for your copy
- Price sensitivity signals

**Outcome:** Know if you should build in 3 days.

---

### Test: Predict Conversion

**Draft Landing Page**
Write your first pass at positioning and copy.

**Test With 100 Users**
Paste your page HTML or URL.
Get 100 user responses in 60 seconds.

**Get Recommendations**
- Predicted conversion rate (e.g., 41%)
- Section-by-section analysis (where they bounce)
- Top 3 specific fixes with expected impact
- Which forces your page addresses (and misses)

**Outcome:** Fix issues before spending on ads.

---

### Build: Context-Aware Development

**Install MCP Server**
One command: `npx validated-context init`

**Claude Code Reads Your Validation**
Now when you prompt Claude:
- It knows customer pain points
- It uses their exact language
- It addresses their anxieties
- It emphasizes features they want

**Outcome:** Build the right thing, faster.

---

## FAQ

**How is this different from "just talking to customers"?**
Jobs-to-be-Done methodology extracts unbiased insights. 
Most founders ask leading questions and get polite lies.

**Can't I just use ChatGPT to analyze interviews?**
Sure. But it won't build force profiles, predict success,
or connect to your coding workflow. This does.

**What if my idea fails validation?**
GOOD. You saved 2 months. Validate another idea in 3 days.
Repeat until you find strong signal.

**Is landing page testing accurate?**
70%+ correlation with real conversion in our validation study.
Better than guessing. Not perfect. Science, not magic.

**Why the MCP integration?**
Because context-switching is expensive. If Claude Code already
knows your customers, you build faster and better.

## Complete Landing Page: Version 5 (Confidence Focus)

```markdown
# Ship With Confidence, Not Guesswork

Master customer interviews in days, test your landing page,
then build with Claude Code using validated insights.

## The Anxiety Every Builder Feels

You're about to spend 2 months building something.

But you're not sure if:
- Anyone actually has this problem
- They'd pay for your solution  
- Your positioning will resonate
- Your landing page will convert

So you either:
1. **Guess and ship** (5% success rate)
2. **Overthink and stall** (0% success rate)

**There's a third option: Validate fast, ship confident.**

---

## From Anxiety to Confidence in 3 Days

---

### Day 2: Conduct Structured Interviews

**The Anxiety:**
"I've never done customer research. Will I mess it up?"

**The Solution:**
Follow the question guide. Record your calls.
Paste interview notes into analyzer.

Get instant force analysis:

Draft your landing page. Paste it in.
Get 100 user responses in 60 seconds.

Predicted conversion: 58%
Top issue: Pricing section (73% bounce)
Fix: Add social proof + free trial

Re-test: 73% predicted conversion

**The Confidence:**

Install MCP server: `npx validated-context init`

Now Claude Code reads your validation automatically:
- Customer pain words
- Anxiety barriers  
- Feature priorities
- Positioning insights

**The Confidence:**
"Claude is building with the same customer understanding I have."

---

## What Changes When You're Confident

### Without Validation (Anxiety-Driven)

❌ "I think people want this... maybe?"  
❌ "My friend said it's a good idea"  
❌ "I'll just ship and see what happens"  
❌ Build for 2 months → 0 users → Restart

**Feeling:** Anxious, hoping, second-guessing

---

### With Validation (Confidence-Driven)

✅ "10 people told me this costs them $500/month"  
✅ "Force analysis shows STRONG build signal"  
✅ "Landing page tested at 68% conversion"  
✅ Build for 2 weeks → Launch → Revenue in 30 days

**Feeling:** Confident, focused, clear

### For Reddit Posts

**r/SideProject**
Title: "I built a tool to validate SaaS ideas in days (using JTBD + MCP integration)"

Body:
"After building 3 products that got 0 users, I learned about Jobs-to-be-Done methodology. Game changer. But customer research was still slow.

So I built a platform that:
- Generates perfect interview questions for any idea
- Analyzes interview notes to tell you if you should build  
- Tests landing pages with 100 users before launch
- Connects to Claude Code via MCP so it builds with customer context

Been using it on myself (meta). Validated this tool using the tool. Built it using validated insights fed to Claude Code.

Early access: [link]

Happy to answer questions about JTBD or the tech stack."

---

**r/Entrepreneur**  
Title: "How to know if your idea will make money (before building it)"

Body:
"I wasted 6 months building products nobody wanted. Here's what changed:

Started using Jobs-to-be-Done methodology for customer interviews. Instead of asking 'Would you use this?' I ask:
- When did you first notice this problem?
- What have you tried before?
- What's it costing you?
- What made you hesitant about previous solutions?

10 interviews = crystal clear picture of whether to build.

Made a tool that automates this process. Generates questions, analyzes responses, tests landing pages. 3 days instead of 3 weeks.

Also connects to Claude Code (for builders) so your code is written with customer context.

Free tier available: [link]"

---

**r/startups**
Title: "Jobs-to-be-Done + AI coding tools = validated products faster"

Body:
"Thesis: The bottleneck isn't building anymore (Claude Code/Cursor are fast). The bottleneck is knowing WHAT to build.

Solution: Connect customer validation to coding workflow.

How:
1. Interview customers using JTBD methodology (reveals real needs)
2. Analyze with force profiles (know if you should build)  
3. Test landing page (predict conversion)
4. Install MCP server (Claude Code reads validation data)
5. Build with context (Claude uses customer language, addresses real pain)

I'm building this platform and using it to validate itself (meta).

Results: Last product (no validation) = 0 users. Current product (validated) = 50 waitlist signups in 3 days, 10 paid interviews, strong force signals.

Early access: [link]"

### For IndieHackers

**Post Title**: "Validating a validation tool (meta + learning in public)"

**Post Body**:
"**The Problem I'm Solving**

Indie hackers ship fast (thanks Claude Code/Cursor) but often build the wrong thing. Customer validation is too slow/expensive, so most skip it.

**The Solution I'm Building**

Platform that:
- Teaches Jobs-to-be-Done while you validate
- Tests landing pages before launch
- Connects to Claude Code via MCP (so it builds with customer context)

**The Meta Approach**

I'm validating this tool using the tool itself:
- Generated interview questions
- Interviewed 10 vibe coders
- Got strong force signals (PUSH 78, PULL 82)
- Tested landing page (68% predicted conversion)
- Building with validated insights

**Current Progress**
- Day 3: 50 waitlist signups
- Day 10: Completed validation phase
- Day 15: Shipping Phase 1 (question generator)
- Day 21: First revenue target: $950

**What I'm Learning**

JTBD methodology is legit. Every interview reveals something I would've built wrong. The force framework (PUSH, PULL, ANXIETY, HABIT) predicts build success better than my gut.

## Color/Tone Suggestions

**Avoid:**
- Bright, saturated colors (feels gimmicky)
- Too much purple/pink (every AI tool uses this)
- Corporate blue (feels enterprise, not indie)

**Consider:**
- Dark mode default (developers prefer)
- Muted, professional palette
- Green for "build signals" (positive)
- Red for "pain points" (attention)
- Yellow for "anxiety barriers" (caution)
- One accent color for CTAs (orange, teal, or deep blue)

**Typography:**
- Sans-serif (Inter, Geist, or similar)
- Good readability (18px minimum body text)
- Clear hierarchy (headlines 2-3x larger than body)

## Final Recommendation

For your first landing page, I'd go with:

**Version 1 (Problem-First) with these tweaks:**
- Use the "Stop Building Products Nobody Wants" headline
- Keep subheadline simple: "Validate ideas through customer interviews, then build with Claude Code using those insights."
- Use Value Props Set A (Process-Focused) - clearest for first-time visitors
- Include minimal FAQ (5 questions)
- Single CTA: "Join the Waitlist"
- Social proof: "Join 200+ builders" (update this number as it grows)

**Why this version:**
1. Immediate emotional hook (everyone's felt this pain)
2. Clear three-step process
3. Not overwhelming with features
4. MCP mentioned but not overemphasized
5. Clean path to CTA

**Test these headlines in A/B:**
- A: "Stop Building Products Nobody Wants"
- B: "Validate Your Idea in 3 Days, Not 3 Weeks"

See which converts better after 100-200 visitors.

Ready to build! This should give Claude Code plenty of context to create a great landing page. Good luck! 🚀
