# Go-To-Market Strategy: AI PM Copilot for Vibe Coders

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: November 26, 2025  
**Status**: Pre-Launch Planning

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

The competitive analysis revealed a genuine market gap: **no platform connects JTBD customer validation to AI coding workflows**. Enterprise tools (Outset.ai at $21M funding, UserTesting at $26K-42K/year) are unaffordable for indie builders, while vibe coders skip validation entirely because existing methods are too slow/expensive.

### The Strategy

**Build the product while using it to validate itself** — creating authentic proof the methodology works, generating content from real data, and attracting early adopters who follow the journey. Each phase ships an independently useful product that generates revenue and validates the next feature.

### The Meta-Narrative

> "I'm building a validation tool by validating it. Watch me use JTBD to decide what to build, ship weekly, share all the data, and prove the product works by using it on itself."

This creates:
- ✅ Authentic proof the methodology works
- ✅ Real-time #buildinpublic content
- ✅ Early adopters who follow the journey  
- ✅ A feedback loop that improves the product
- ✅ SEO content from actual validation stories

### Success Criteria by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | Revenue Target | Key Metric |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Phase 0 | Weeks 1-2 | $0 (validation) | 100 waitlist signups |
| Phase 1 | Weeks 3-4 | $950+ | 50 paid conversions at $19 |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 5-6 | $2,000 MRR | 100 paying users |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 7-10 | $5,000 MRR | 200 paying users |
| Phase 4 | Weeks 11-14 | $10,000 MRR | 500 MCP installations |

1. "Tell me about the last time you built something nobody used."
2. "What triggered you to start that project?" (PUSH)
3. "What did you hope it would do for you?" (PULL)
4. "What made you hesitate or almost not build it?" (ANXIETY)
5. "What did you do instead before building?" (HABIT)
6. "How do you validate ideas today?" (Current workflow)
7. "What would make validation fast enough to actually do?"
8. "If this tool existed tomorrow, what's the first thing you'd validate?"

### Product Specification

#### Core Feature: Interview Analyzer

**User Flow:**
1. Navigate to: "/analyze" 
2. Paste interview notes (raw text, 500-5000 characters)
3. Claude API processes with prompt:
   - Extract Four Forces with strength scores (0-100)

**Analysis Output Format:**
```markdown
## Interview Analysis

**Build Signal**: 🟢 STRONG (85/100)

### Four Forces Profile

**PUSH (Strength: 78/100)** 🔴
Current state is painful enough to motivate change:
- "I wasted 3 weeks building something nobody wanted" [Frustration]
- "It's embarrassing showing investors a failed product" [Social cost]
- "Can't afford to waste more time guessing" [Financial pressure]

**PULL (Strength: 82/100)** 🟢  
New solution is attractive:
- "If I could validate in days instead of weeks..." [Speed]
- "Having AI coach me through JTBD would be amazing" [Support]
- "Claude Code already knows my code, why not my customers?" [Integration]

**ANXIETY (Strength: 45/100)** 🟡
Concerns about new solution:
- "Will the AI give me bad advice?" [Trust]
- "Is $49/month worth it for a solo founder?" [Cost]
- "How accurate are synthetic users really?" [Skepticism]

**HABIT (Strength: 62/100)** 🔵
What they do now instead:
- "I just build and see what happens" [Current state]
- "Sometimes I post on Reddit for feedback" [Existing workaround]
- "I read my own customer reviews" [Alternative]

### Struggling Moments (Timeline)
1. **Trigger**: Built product for 2 months → 0 users signed up
2. **First Thought**: "Maybe I should have validated first?"
3. **Passive Looking**: Googled "how to validate startup ideas"
4. **Active Searching**: Tried 3-4 tools, all too slow/expensive
5. **Deciding**: "Next time I'm validating BEFORE building"
6. **Now**: Actively looking for fast, affordable validation

### Customer Language Patterns

**Pain Words** (use in copy):
- "waste", "embarrassing", "guessing", "frustrated", "anxious"

**Desired Outcomes** (use in headlines):
- "confident", "validated", "fast", "proven", "ready to launch"

**Anxiety Words** (address in copy):
- "trust", "accurate", "worth it", "actually works"

### Recommendation

**BUILD THIS** ✅

Reasoning:
- Strong PUSH + PULL (78+82=160 combined strength)
- Moderate ANXIETY (can be addressed with social proof)
- Struggling moment is clear and recurring
- Willingness to pay signal present ($49/month mentioned)
- Multiple competing forces = active buyer

**Key Risks to Address**:
1. Build trust through case studies and accuracy data
2. Show clear ROI vs. cost of failed products
3. Offer trial or money-back guarantee to lower anxiety

**Next Steps**:
1. Conduct 5 more interviews to validate force patterns
2. Test messaging that addresses top 3 anxieties
3. Build MVP focused on speed (their #1 PULL force)

## Landing Page Test Results

**URL**: https://yourproduct.com  
**Agents tested**: 50 synthetic users based on [SaaS Founder] profile  
**Test completed**: November 27, 2025 at 2:34 PM

### Conversion Prediction: 41% 🟡

Based on 50 synthetic agents with your validated force profile:
- 21 agents would convert (sign up for trial)
- 19 agents would bounce at specific friction points
- 10 agents need more information before deciding

**Confidence level**: 85% (high)  
**Benchmark**: Average for your industry is 28%

### Force Coverage Analysis

How well your page addresses each psychological force:

**PUSH (Pain Points)**: 85% covered ✅
- ✅ "Stop wasting time building products nobody wants"
- ✅ "Launching without validation is embarrassing"
- ❌ Missing: Cost of failed products (mentioned by 70% of interviews)

**PULL (Desired Outcomes)**: 72% covered 🟡
- ✅ "Validate in days, not weeks"
- ✅ "AI-powered JTBD methodology"
- ❌ Missing: Specific success metrics (e.g., "95% accuracy")

**ANXIETY (Trust Barriers)**: 45% covered 🔴
- ❌ No social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- ❌ No trust signals (security badges, money-back guarantee)
- ❌ Pricing not transparent (CTA says "See pricing")

**HABIT (Current Alternatives)**: 60% covered 🟡
- ✅ Mentions competitors (Outset.ai, UserTesting)
- ❌ Doesn't explain why you're better
- ❌ No "switching costs" mitigation (easy import, no contract)

### Bounce Analysis (Section by Section)

**Hero Section** (Bounce: 12%)
- ✅ Headline resonates with PUSH force
- ❌ 6 agents confused by "AI PM Copilot" terminology
- Recommendation: Add clarifying subheadline

**Features Section** (Bounce: 8%)

- ❌ 14 agents concerned about $49/month ROI
- Recommendation: Add "14-day free trial" + "Cancel anytime"

**CTA Buttons** (Bounce: 22%)
- ❌ "Get Started" is generic
- ❌ 11 agents want to see what happens after clicking
- Recommendation: Change to "Start Free Trial" + preview next step

### Top 3 Recommendations

**1. Add Social Proof to Pricing Section** (Expected impact: +15%)
- What: 3-5 testimonials from early users near pricing
- Why: 58% bounce due to trust anxiety
- How: "Join 200+ builders validating products faster"
- Expected conversion: 41% → 56%

**2. Offer Free Trial** (Expected impact: +12%)

- Why: 45% anxiety about committing $49/month
- How: Change primary CTA to "Start Free Trial"
- Expected conversion: 56% → 68%

**3. Clarify "AI PM Copilot" in Subheadline** (Expected impact: +5%)
- What: Add explanatory subheadline under hero
- Why: 12% confused by terminology
- How: "The AI assistant that validates your product ideas using customer interviews"
- Expected conversion: 68% → 73%

### Agent Insights (Sample Quotes)

**Agent #7** (Strong PUSH, High ANXIETY):
> "I love the idea of fast validation, but $49/month feels risky without trying it first. Show me it works and I'm in."

**Agent #23** (Strong PULL, Medium ANXIETY):
> "The MCP integration is genius — I use Claude Code daily. If this actually feeds customer insights to Claude, I'd pay $99/month."

**Agent #41** (Medium PUSH, Strong HABIT):
> "I already use Maze for $75/month. Why should I switch? Your page doesn't explain what makes you different."

### Next Steps

1. Implement recommendations 1-3 (estimated 2 days of work)
2. Re-test with 100 agents to validate improvements
3. Launch improved page and compare real conversion rate
4. Expected real-world conversion: 65-75% (vs. current unknown)

#### Synthetic Agent Architecture

**How We Generate Realistic Agents:**

1. **Base Profile** (from your interviews):
   - Force strengths: PUSH=78, PULL=82, ANXIETY=45, HABIT=62
   - Demographics: 30-40 year old, technical founder, $0-10K MRR
   - Psychographics: Risk-averse, time-constrained, values speed
   - Customer language: Uses words like "waste", "embarrassing", "confident"

2. **Agent Variation** (to create 50 unique agents):
   - Vary force strengths by ±20 points
   - Randomize secondary concerns
   - Introduce edge cases (ultra-price-sensitive, ultra-skeptical, etc.)
   - Distribution: 40% typical, 30% skeptical, 20% enthusiastic, 10% edge cases

3. **Simulation Process**:
   - Agent "reads" each section of landing page
   - Evaluates against their force profile
   - Decides: Continue reading | Bounce | Convert
   - Generates reasoning: "Why I bounced at pricing section"

4. **Aggregation**:
   - Calculate conversion % across all agents
   - Identify common bounce points
   - Extract representative quotes
   - Rank recommendations by predicted impact

#### Accuracy Validation (Critical for Trust)

**Phase 3A (Weeks 7-8): Accuracy Testing**

Before full launch, validate synthetic agent predictions:

1. **Test Design**:
   - Find 10 real landing pages with known conversion rates
   - Run synthetic tests on each (100 agents per page)
   - Compare predicted conversion vs. actual conversion

2. **Success Criteria**:
   - Correlation: R² > 0.70 (strong correlation)
   - Mean Absolute Error: <15 percentage points
   - Example: Predicts 45%, actual is 38% → 7 point error ✅

3. **Public Results**:
   - Blog post: "We Tested 10 Landing Pages With AI. Here's The Accuracy."
   - Show all 10 comparisons with real data
   - Explain methodology and limitations
   - Build trust through transparency

**If accuracy is insufficient:**
- Iterate on agent modeling (add more psychological variables)
- Tune force strength calculations
- Consider hybrid approach (AI + simple rules)

### Monetization Strategy

### Product Specification

#### Core Feature: MCP Server for AI Coding Tools

**What It Does:**
Feeds validated customer insights directly to Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding assistants via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**User Experience:**
```bash
# One-command installation
npx validated-context init

# Validates connection
✓ Connected to Validated.ai API
✓ Found project: "SaaS Validator Tool" (ID: abc123)
✓ MCP server running on localhost:3000
✓ Claude Code configuration updated

# What Claude Code can now do:
"Hey Claude, build my landing page"

[Claude Code automatically queries MCP server]
→ Retrieves validated force profile
→ Knows customer pain words: "waste time", "embarrassing"
→ Knows anxiety barriers: "trust AI", "worth $49/month"
→ Generates page using exact customer language
→ Tests each section against force profile
→ Outputs landing page with 73% predicted conversion

# vs. without MCP:
"Hey Claude, build my landing page"
[Claude Code generates generic template with 15% predicted conversion]
```

**MCP Server API Endpoints:**

1. **`get_validation(projectId)`**
   - Returns: Force profile, ICP, positioning, customer language

   - Returns: Copy written in validated customer language
   - Use case: "Write my pricing section"

3. **`test_copy(projectId, html)`**
   - Input: HTML content or live URL
   - Returns: Conversion prediction, force coverage, recommendations
   - Use case: "Test this landing page"

4. **`validate_feature(projectId, featureDescription)`**
   - Input: "Add real-time collaboration to editor"
   - Returns: Alignment score (0-1) with force profile, reasoning
   - Use case: "Should I build this feature?"

5. **`update_with_real_data(projectId, conversionData)`**
   - Input: Actual conversion rate, user behavior
   - Returns: Updated force model, new recommendations

      }
    };
  }

  // Tool 2: Generate Copy
  async generateCopy(projectId: string, section: string) {
    const validation = await this.getValidation(projectId);
    const prompt = `Generate ${section} using these validated insights:
      - Customer pain words: ${validation.customerLanguage.painWords}
      - Desired outcomes: ${validation.customerLanguage.desiredOutcomes}
      - Top PUSH force: ${validation.forces.push.topItems[0]}
      - Top ANXIETY: ${validation.forces.anxiety.topItems[0]}
    `;
    return await this.api.generateContent(prompt);
  }

  // Tool 3: Test Copy
  async testCopy(projectId: string, html: string) {
    const validation = await this.getValidation(projectId);
    return await this.api.runSyntheticTest({
      html,
      forceProfile: validation.forces,
      agentCount: 100
    });
  }

  // Tool 4: Validate Feature
  async validateFeature(projectId: string, featureDesc: string) {
    const validation = await this.getValidation(projectId);
    const analysis = await this.api.analyzeFeature({
      feature: featureDesc,
      forces: validation.forces
    });
    return {
      alignmentScore: analysis.score,
      reasoning: analysis.reasoning,
      recommendation: analysis.score > 0.7 ? "BUILD" : "RECONSIDER"
    };
  }
}

// CLI Installation

#### Week 12: Content Buildup

**The Demo That Goes Viral:**

**Video Script** (3-5 minutes):
```
[Screen recording]

"Watch what happens when Claude Code knows your customers.

First, without MCP:
> 'Hey Claude, build my landing page'
[Shows generic output with boring copy]
Predicted conversion: 15%

Now, WITH our MCP server:
> 'Hey Claude, build my landing page'
[Claude automatically queries MCP]
[Shows it reading force profile, customer language]
[Generates page with specific pain words from interviews]
Predicted conversion: 68%

The difference? Claude Code now has access to validated customer insights.

Here's how it works:
1. Run customer interviews using our tool
2. Install MCP server: 'npx validated-context init'
3. Claude Code can now query your validation data
4. Every feature, every copy, informed by real psychology

This is context-aware coding. 

And it changes everything."

### Churn Prevention Strategy

**Onboarding** (First 7 days):
- Day 1: Welcome email + quick start guide
- Day 2: "Generate your first interview questions"
- Day 3: "Conduct your first interview (tips inside)"
- Day 4: "Analyze your interview results"
- Day 5: "Test your landing page with synthetic users"
- Day 6: "Install MCP server (optional)"
- Day 7: "You're set up! Here's what's next"

**Engagement Triggers**:
- No activity for 7 days → "Miss us? Here's how to get back on track"
- 1 analysis only → "Most users run 5+ analyses. Try another!"
- No synthetic test → "Have you tested your landing page yet?"
- MCP installed but unused → "Here's how to use MCP effectively"

**Retention Features**:
- Progress tracking: "You've analyzed 15 interviews, tested 8 pages"
- Milestones: "Congrats on validating your first product!"
- Comparative data: "Your force scores are stronger than 70% of users"

**Win-Back Campaign** (churned users):
- Day 1 after churn: "We're sad to see you go. Quick survey?"
- Day 7: "We've added [new feature]. Want to try it?"
- Day 30: "Come back for 50% off your first month"

**Target Churn**: <10% monthly (excellent for SaaS)

## Why This Approach Works

### 1. Risk Mitigation
- Each phase proves value before building more
- Can stop at any point if signals are weak
- Capital efficient (no big upfront investment)
- Revenue funds future development

### 2. Learning Velocity
- Ship weekly → learn weekly
- Tight feedback loops
- Pivot fast if needed
- Build what people want, not what you guessed

### 3. Authentic Story
- Not selling vaporware
- Using product on itself (meta-validation)
- Real data, real results
- The product validates itself

### 4. Network Effects
- Free tools generate traffic
- Content builds SEO
- Building in public creates community
- Success compounds

### 5. Compounding Value
- Each phase builds on previous
- Email list grows continuously
- Content library accumulates
- Brand authority strengthens

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Execution Speed
- Ship Phase 1 in 2 weeks, not 2 months
- Fast feedback loops
- Bias toward action

### 2. Transparency
- Share all metrics publicly
- Show failures, not just wins
- Build trust through honesty

### 3. Quality
- Product must actually work
- Accuracy is critical for synthetic testing
- Polish matters for conversion

### 4. Community
- Respond to every comment
- Build relationships, not just followers
- Create advocates

### 5. Discipline
- Follow the plan
- Don't skip validation steps
- Respect the go/no-go criteria

---

## Next Steps (Choose One to Start Tomorrow)

### Option A: Write Landing Page (2 hours)
- Create Carrd account
- Write 3 value props
- Add waitlist form
- Post on Twitter

**Why this**: Fastest signal, zero code

---

### Option B: Conduct First Interview (1 hour)
- Email someone who matches ICP
- Schedule 30-minute call
- Ask JTBD questions
- Document forces

**Why this**: Validate the validation tool meta-approach

---

### Option C: Build Question Generator (1 day)
- Set up Next.js project
- Claude API integration
- Simple form → generate questions
- Deploy to Vercel

**Why this**: Ship something useful immediately

---

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (landing page). 

**Reason**: Lowest effort, fastest signal, tests positioning before building anything.

**After landing page**: Conduct 10 interviews (Option B), then build based on data (Option C).
