- Components with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Optional deployment with [Supabase Vercel Integration and Vercel deploy](#deploy-your-own)
  - Environment variables automatically assigned to Vercel project

## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

### Automatic Database Migrations on Vercel

This project is configured to automatically run database migrations during the Vercel build process. The build script in `package.json` will:

1. Create a Supabase configuration file
2. Link your Supabase project
3. Push database migrations using `supabase db push`
4. Build the Next.js application

For this to work properly, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
- `SUPABASE_API_KEY`: Your Supabase service role API key (found in Project Settings > API)
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`: Your Supabase project reference ID (optional if `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` is provided)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).

## Todo List setup
Add this schema to your Supabase project:

Create initial migration by running the following command

```bash
cd supabase
supabase db diff --use-migra --file=initial
```

This will create a new migration file in the `supabase/migrations` directory.

You can now run the following command to apply the migration:

```bash
cd supabase
supabase db migrate apply
```

initial file contains:
```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add RLS policies
ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to only allow users to see their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own todos" ON todos
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to only allow users to insert their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own todos" ON todos
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to only allow users to update their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can only update their own todos" ON todos
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy to only allow users to delete their own todos
CREATE POLICY "Users can only delete their own todos" ON todos
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
